%explain about pressure propagation and statistics
%The long-term goal of the \ak\ project is to provide an environment for development of scalable concurrent applications that do not require manual tuning efforts. Though the adaptive self-regulation mechanism is not known to propose something for synchronisers, we try to review the possible strategies for the pressure propagation through synchroniser.
