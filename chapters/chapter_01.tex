\chapter{Introduction}
For years, processor manufacturers have delivered increases in clock rates. While manufacturing technology still improves, physical limitations of semiconductor-based electronics have become a major concern of design. In order for the processors to continue to improve in performance, multi-core design has become necessary.

Unlike the increase in clock frequency, increasing the number of processor cores does not provide automatic benefits for conventional programs. Parallel programming in the conventional style is difficult because computation is mixed with concurrency management, which includes ensuring the correct sequencing of the interactions between different computational executions, and coordinating access to resources that are shared among executions. One of the approaches that addresses the issue of mixed computation and coordination is to separate these concerns. The approach requires explicit parallelisation of an application and specification of component communication in so-called coordination language.

The concept of a new coordination language \ak\ is described in \cite{astrakahn}. The language defines the coordination behaviour of networks of asynchronous components (boxes) and their orderly interconnection via stream-carrying channels. The \ak\ computation model is based on Kahn process networks, where processes communicate via unbounded FIFO channels. However, in real-world applications, a large number of concurrent processes and their communication facilities share a very limited amount of resources. In order to deal with the issue of application progress, \ak\ attempts to provide a self-regulatory concurrency mechanism based on the concept of communication pressure. Concurrency regulation supposes that several copies of a box may run in parallel, thus \ak\ requires boxes to keep no state. A stateless box knows nothing about synchronisation, therefore data must be synchronised before they are sent to a box. \ak\ provides a synchronisation facility -- a synchroniser -- that is able to store received data and retrieve them for the sole purpose of sending them on, either as they are, or combined with other stored or received data and with trivial data extensions computed by the synchroniser itself.
% ak achieves separation of coordination and synchronisation concerns as well

Boxes are connected to the streaming network with one or two input channels and one or more output channels. Synchronisers may have many input channels. Streaming networks in \ak\ are expressed with four wiring patterns, namely serial and parallel composition, wrap-around connection and serial replication.


    \section{Motivation}
%write about the state of the project. the runtime system needs to be developed before the regulation research.
The \ak\ project is now in its initial state and there is yet no implementation. The playground environment need to be developed for the research towards the self-regulation.

The aim of this thesis is to identify the role of the synchroniser analysis in the project. It includes implementation of the \ak\ synchroniser and integration of the implementation into the runtime system prototype. The output form the infinite replication relies on the synchroniser analysis.

%explain about pressure propagation and statistics
The long-term goal of the \ak\ project is to provide an environment for development of scalable concurrent applications that do not require manual tuning efforts. Though the adaptive self-regulation mechanism is not known to propose something for synchronisers, we try to review the possible strategies for the pressure propagation through synchroniser.


%An Astra\emph{Kahn} approach to adaptive concurrency relies on the concept of communication pressure propagation across a network. Since pressure propagation directly affects proliferation levels of certain vertices, effectiveness of concurrency self-regulation depends largely on correctness of pressure propagation strategy. An important part of this strategy is pressure propagation through synchronisers because, unlike other vertices in Astra\emph{Kahn}, they induce negative pressure that represents a demand for messages in a certain part of a network.

%This project is focused on synchroniser analysis and development of supporting tools. Since the synchroniser is programmed in a dedicated language, a compiler for this language is needed. Target architecture assembly generation is of no concern within the project, thus, the compiler translates a given source code into a C program and then calls available C compiler to generate an executable file. Also, the compiler provides various syntactic and semantic checks.

%In order to propagate pressure through a synchroniser, Astra\emph{Kahn} coordinator needs to know its \emph{transfer function}. The transfer function describes relations between demands of messages on a synchroniser's input and output channels. Derivation of the transfer function is a concern of static analysis, in particular, execution path analysis. Because synchronisers are non-deterministic, there may be potentially an infinite number of possible execution paths and therefore more than one transfer function. It may be impossible to determine an exact execution path at compile time, because it may depend on incoming message content. If synchroniser has an inner loop, the transfer function must consider the number of iterations in this loop. Thus, transfer function derivation relates to induction variable analysis.

%These issues are subject to synchroniser analysis in the project. Once a set of transfer functions is obtained, it is up to TPL how to choose a particular transfer function and propagate pressure through a synchroniser. Also, synchroniser analysis includes passport generation for Constraint Aggregation Layer.


    \section{Contribution}
The contribution of the research is a technique for pressure propagation through synchronisers. This mechanism is an important part of concurrency self-regulating mechanism in Astra\emph{Kahn}. An approach to the problem will be provided in accordance with runtime system regulation policies and a tool for pressure propagation support on runtime will be implemented. The chosen pressure propagation strategy will be tested with a runtime system prototype to decide on its usability for adaptive concurrency regulation. Depending on the result, synchronisation model nondeterminism restrictions and/or strategy changes can be provided to enable efficient concurrency self-regulation on runtime.

    \section{Coordination Programming}
The coordination paradigm offers a promising way to address some issues related to the development of efficient parallel systems. Programming a parallel system can be seen as the combination of two activities: the actual computing part comprising a number of processes that manipulate data and a coordination part that is responsible for the communication between the processes.

Basically, coordination is managing dependencies between components. Since the computation is completely separated from the coordination activity, the processes that comprise the former are seen as black boxes. Hence, the actual programming languages used to write the computational code do not play important role in setting up the coordination scheme. Thus, the concept of coordination is closely related to heterogenity.

Existing coordination models\footnote{A coordination model constitutes the entities being coordinated, the means used to ccordinate the entities and the semantic framework the model adheres to} are described in details in the survey \cite{papadopoulos} by G. Papadopoulos and F. Arbab. They argue that these models fall into two major categories of coordination programming, namely either data-driven or control-driven.

The main characteristic of the data-driven coordination models is that coordinated processes are responsible for both examining and manipulating data as well as for coordinating either themselves and/or other processes by invoking the coordination mechanism each language provides. This means that the coordination and computation code are mixed within the process definition. A data-driven coordination language typically offers several coordination primitives which are mixed with the purely computational part of code.

Many data-driven coordination models have evolved around the notion of a shared dataspace. The shared dataspace plays the dual role, being a global data repository and an interprocess communication system. The processes communicate among themselves writing to the shared dataspace and retrieving data from it. Hystorically the first member of this family is Linda \cite{linda}.

Strictly speaking, not all data-driven coordination models follow the above pattern of coordination. Some of them use a message-passing based mechanism (MPI, \cite{mpi}).

Opposite to the data-driven coordination model, the control-driven coordination model achieves almost complete separation of computation and coordination concerns. This is usually achieved by defining a special language that offers facilities for controlling synchronisation, communication, creation and termination of computing components. One of contemporary members of this family is Reo \cite{Reo_Arbab04}.

In Reo the computational components communicate via complex coordinators, or \emph{connectors}. An undirected channel is an atomic connector in Reo. Channels are typed, however, no fixed set of types is assumed. The channel type defines the synchronisational behaviour of the channel with respect to data.

Channels are connected with \emph{nodes}. Nodes have fixed merger-replicator behaviour: the data of one of the incoming channels is propagated to all outgoing channels, without storing or altering the data. If multiple incoming channel can provide data, the node make a nondeterministic choice among them.

Complex connector in Reo is represented as undirected graph contisting of channels and nodes. C. Baier et al. propose \emph{constraint automata} as an operational model for component connectors in Reo \cite{baier_ca}.


    \section{Stream Processing}
The term stream processing refers to the study of a number of disparate systems, such as dataflow systems, reactive systems, signal processing systems, etc. However, conceptually the analysis of each of these systems is usually based on the study of a patricular type of stream processing system. A stream processing system is a system comprised of a collection of processes that compute in parallel and communicate data via channels. The processes are ususally divided into three classes: sources that pass data into the system, filters that perform some atomic computation, and sinks that pass data from the system. Stream processing systems are usually visualised as directed graphs.

An overview of the hystorical development and the discussion of the different techniques for streams programming is presented in the survey by R. Stephens \cite{stephens97}. Stephens identifies that the first type of stream processing systems are dataflow systems. In the first dataflow programming language Lucid \cite{lucid}, each variable is represented as an infinite stream of values. Computation is carried out by defining transformation functions that process these streams. Lucid is possibly the first language to introduce the idea of a filter.

A significant result for concurrency engineering is Kahn's work \cite{kahn74} that outlines the semantics of a simple parallel programming language. Kahn suggests a distributed model of computation where a group of deterministic sequential processes communicate via unbounded FIFO channels under the following assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Channels are the only way for processes to communicate
\item Channels transmit messages within a finite time
\item At any given time a process is either performing computation or waiting for messages on one of its input channels.
\end{itemize}
Kahn proved that the output of the resulting process network is deterministic, i.e. it does not depend on the mutual order of computations at different nodes. The model is now referred to as Kahn Process Network (KPN).

A Kahn process may have multiple input and multiple output channels. Reading from a channel in KPN is blocking, i.e. a process that reads from an empty channel stalls and can only continue when the channel contains sufficient data.  On contrary, writing to a channel is non-blocking and it always succeeds since channels capacity in KPN is unlimited. Processes cannot test an input channel for data availability without consuming the data. KPNs allow arbitrary wiring, i.e. the network may have feedback communication.

In KPNs the number of data elements a process might read from a channel or write to a channel is not restricted. In synchronous dataflow (SDF, \cite{sdf}) the consumption and production rates of a process that is ready to perform the computation are fixed. Hence, an SDF process computes in a synchronised manner with respect to the processes it is connected to.
%Synchronous dataflow is a restriction of KPNs.
%From operational point of view the dataflow model of computation is divided into two basic froms: data-driven (filters compute depending upon the availability of data at their inputs), and demand-driven (filters request data on the input lines when they wish to compute).

A recent SDF implementation in programming languages is StreamIt \cite{streamit}. The basic unit of computation in StreamIt is a user-defined single-input single-output (SISO) block that translates input data sequences to output sequences called a filter. A filter can communicate with neighbouring blocks via FIFO channels. StreamIt imposes structuring on applications with the following structural primitives:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Pipeline} specifies sequential composition of filters,
\item \emph{SplitJoin} specifies parallel composition of filters,
\item and \emph{FeedbackLoop} provides a way to create loop constructs in a streaming network.
\end{itemize}
A StreamIt program is a hierarchical composition of these constructs.

With the restriction to a single input and a single output, a filter is relieved from questions to what extent to synchronise data on multiple input channels and to which of multiple output to send the output.


    \section{S-Net}
S-Net \cite{snet_intro} is a declarative coordination language based on stream processing. S-Net defines the coordination of stateless asynchronous components (boxes) that interact with each other in a streaming network. Boxes are written in conventional languages that are subject to contract with S-Net. Boxes execute fully asynchronously, i.e. a box may consume data as soon as it is available in the input stream. Moreover, boxes are SISO, therefore S-Net achieves a near-complete separation of communication and computation concerns.

Streaming networks are expressed in a hierarchical composition of a fixed set of four combinators, namely serial composition, parallel composition, serial replication and parallel replication. All the combinators except for the serial composition are non-deterministic in a sense that the input data may be reordered in the output stream. For non-deterministic combinators there exist deterministic variants.

S-Net provides a special kind of box, called a synchrocell, that implements barrier synchronisation on streams. Data on streams are organised as records of label-value pairs. A synchrocell maintains an internal state in order to keep a record coming from each of its input streams. Once a synchrocell has collected records from all of its input streams, it merges the records into a single one and emits then the result to the output stream.


%Optionally: synchronisers can be used for monitoring of network
    \section{\ak\ Approach to Streaming Networks}
The \ak\ computation model is based on Kahn's model of process networks. Program in Atra\emph{Kahn} is represented as a directed graph of computational processes connected with edges that are stream-carrying channels.

% Relation to KPNs
What properties of KPNs do \ak\ inherit? What are the differences?


The semantics of AstraKahn on the TPL is described in terms of structures put in place for the coordinator, i.e. a controlling agent, or indeed a group of agents, responsible for progress and communication of the KPN vertices. The vertices are connected by stream-carrying channels using wiring patterns.


Though \ak\ preserves certain properties of KPNs, it provides the following refinements:
\begin{description}
\item[complete separation of coordination logic from computations]

This refinement leaves computational components stateless and opens opportunities for easier parallelisation. Coordination logic is expressed in special vertices called \emph{synchronisers}. \emph{Synchronisers} are programmed in dedicated programming language;
\item[self-regulatory concurrency mechanism] based on the concept of communication pressure. The mechanism address the issue of application progress under the interpretation when resources are limited. Behavioural classification of computational components is provided along with this mechanism;
\item[separation into independent layers communicating by means of interfaces]

This refinement addresses standard engineering issues such as abstraction, encapsulation and hierarchical development.
\end{description}

As the result of refinement, \ak\ is seen as a construction of three independent layers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Topology and Progress Layer (TPL) defines the topology and provides concurrency regulatory mechanism.
The TPL defines:
1. classes of boxes, their algebraic properties, their effects on channel segmentation and the behaviour under both types of pressure.
2. classes of channels with respect to pressure conductance 3. the language for synchronisers, including:
• the structure of the state, the specification of the state transitions and the associated storage/retrieval behaviour
• pressure creation and conductance • nondeterminism and fairness policies
4. the static wiring patterns 4
5. subnetwork encapsulation facility

\item Constraint Aggregation Layer (CAL) insures type safety all over network with data constraints provided by each component

\item Data Instrumentation Layer (DIL) manages data distribution and concurrent memory access.
\end{itemize}



\paragraph{Boxes}
Boxes are stateless functions that read messages from one (or in some cases two) input channels. Boxes read an input message, do some computation and send messages to output channels.

Boxes are classified

It should be noted that all vertices are pure stream- to-stream prefix-monotonic functions that map the totality of their input streams to the totality of their output streams.

boxes are specified in a
box programming language and are subject to a box contract. The contract sets out acceptable behaviour for a box and is partly cooperative (i.e. cannot be inforced, but any guarantees that AstraKahn makes are subject to the fulfilment of the contract on behalf of all the boxes) and partly enforceable. AstraKahn accepts any box programming language that enables the programmer to fulfil the contract. The interface between a box and the AstraKahn run-time system for any valid implementation is defined by the AstraKahn Box-API for each supported box language.



\paragraph{Synchronisers}
Synchronisers are vertices that can have any number of input channels. Synchronisers have an internal state and generally accept messages from each input channel in some states, while in any of the other states the channel is blocked until a state transition brings the synchroniser to a state in which messages from the channel are accepted, thus unblocking it. Synchronisers are able to store received messages and retrieve them for the sole purpose of sending them on, either as they are, or combined with other stored or received messages and with trivial message extensions computed by the synch itself. The state transitions of a synchroniser can depend on the content of the current message but never on that of a stored one. In other words, a synchroniser is a finite state machine for joining messages and sending them on to its output channels.


\paragraph{Channels}
Bracketing depth of channels

Boxes and synchronisers are connected by segmented channels. A channel carries a stream that
consists of messages and possibly segmentation marks. The latter can be thought of as “brackets”. The intention of the brackets is to mark the beginning and the end of a sequence.

Sequences may in turn consist of sequences in their own right, hence a channel can have a bracketing depth (or depth for short) greater than one. However, each message on a given channel will under all circumstances find itself between the same number of brackets, hence the depth is static, and is a characteristic of a channel available from the TPL.


\paragraph{Network Composition}
% TODO 4 or 5 wiring patterns?

Wiring patterns form a small set: only 5 in total, describing connections between
nodes in a hierarchical way. A pattern is applied to its operand networks, either vertices or groups of nodes already wired up with some wiring patterns. The pattern identifies input/output channels of the operand(s) with one another and with the input/output channels of the result. Four out of five patterns are finite, applicable to one or two operands. The fifth one is infinite as it infinitely replicates the single operand network and wires up an infinite chain. That last pattern can also be dynamic, in the sense that the wiring takes place step-by-step at run time, which is the most complex topological and regulatory behaviour available in TPL.

AstraKahn provides a small set of wiring patterns which is sufficient to achieve arbitrary wiring of the vertices.
- The serial connection
- The parallel connection
- The wrap-around connection

- Infinite star combinator


The construction of networks in AstraKahn is hierarchical: vertices are combined into a subnetwork, which in turn can act as a vertex in a larger network, etc.


\paragraph{The type system of \ak\ }

the role of the CAL in AstraKahn is similar to the role
of the type system in a conventional (non-coordination) programming language. The CAL is, in a way, a universal type system in the sense that it does not fix the structure and meaning of the type assertions that boxes may choose to import and export. It instead provides a constraint programming framework in which a wide variety of assertions can be formulated. It relies on general-purpose constraint solving as a means of type checking, type inference and most general subtyping.

In data communication the static correctness of the channel demands that the statically guaranteed properties of an output message be sufficient to satisfy the static requirements of its recipients.
a vertex is both an originator of its output messages and the recipient of the input ones, and since the input constraints are the necessary condition for the vertex to operate correctly and hence to guarantee the output properties, the vertex can be abstracted with
respect to its data-transformation behaviour as an implicative statement p ⇒ P. Here p is the conjunction of all the requirements and P is the conjunction of all the guarantees. We will call these implications box passports.

A box is represented as a combination of a source code and a triad of the box name, box category and CAL passport. An AstraKahn compiler performs its first (Constraint Aggregation or CA) pass by only taking the above-mentioned triad and the coordination program written in AstraKahn/TPL. During the CA pass, the topology of the network is extracted from the AstraKahn program, the properties of the synchronisers with respect to input terms (i.e. their “passports” if they had one) are inferred from each synchroniser program, and the process of juxtaposition and constraint solving is performed to instantiate all term variables. As a side effect, a proof is obtained that the constraint system is satisfiable, which indicates that all components have received sufficient assurances to guarantee their output, and consequently the whole program that will be generated next is consistent and type correct.

CAL is based on the Message Definition Language (MDL) which is a language of abstract terms that are built recursively from the ground up. Structurally they are symbolic trees with the following kinds of leaf:
-symbol
-number
-string
-variable
-flag

Terms are built recursively using the following types of constructors:
-tuple
-list
-record
-choice
-switch


Data on streams in \ak\ are organised as choices of records.




    \section{Summary}
StreamIt, S-Net and \ak\ share that the networks are constructed with a fixed of combinators. Reo connects the components it coordinates with complex connectors that are constructed of typed channels that express synchronisation.

Which languages separate synchronisation from coordination?
Reo does not.
S-Net (via SISO and synchrocells) and \ak\ (via synchronisers) do.
StreamIt is SISO and based on the SDF model, where neighbouring processes communicate synchronously.

Unlike S-Net or \ak\, Reo connectors never combine (or process) data items. It just sends them as is
